I am an award-winning content developer and technical writer at IBM with 5 years of experience working on Data and AI enterprise software. Before starting my career at IBM, I worked as a technical writer intern at Akamai Technologies and a grant writer intern at UMass Medical School and Memorial Medical Center. In addition to my work experience, I earned my Master of Science in Technical Communication from North Carolina State University and my Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the College of the Holy Cross.

# Animations and diagrams
I've created and edited visual aids such as animations and diagrams to enhance the user experience in the product documentation. I used Camtasia and draw.io to create and edit the following animated GIFs and diagrams:

- [Assigning solution layouts to roles](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/25.0.0?topic=layouts-creating-custom-solution#roles__title__1)
- [Mapping input and output data for an activity in processes or human service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/25.0.x?topic=dpv-mapping-input-output-data-activity-in-processes-human-service)
- [FileNet Content Manager architecture](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=reference-cloud-pak-business-automation-architecture#concept_gjn_4kf_zcc__fncm)

# What's new in IBM Business Automation Workflow
The What's new in IBM Business Automation Workflow topic highlights new IBM Business Automation Workflow features for both current and prospective clients. I collaborate with product management, developers, and other stakeholders to write engaging entries for each product version release.

I lead the development of the What's new topic for the following versions of Business Automation Workflow:

- [25.0.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/25.0.0?topic=information-whats-new-in-25000)
- [24.0.1.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/24.0.x?topic=new-in-24010)
- [24.0.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/24.0.x?topic=new-in-24000)
- [23.0.2](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/23.0.x?topic=new-in-2302)
- [23.0.1](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/23.0.x?topic=new-in-2301)

# Generative AI use cases
As AI technology advances, I am exploring ways to incorporate AI into my daily workflows and use generative AI to increase productivity and enhance IBM's product documentation. All content generated by AI is reviewed and edited for accuracy and compliance with IBM style guidelines.

- [Content Management Interoperability Service audit events](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=records-filenet-content-manager-audit-log#reference_ic5_hjh_gfc__cmis_audit_events__title__1)<br>
I used AI to convert input from the development team into a DITA definition list for the reference documentation.
- [Content services new features and enhancements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=notes-whats-new-in-2500#whatsnew__content)<br>
I prompted AI to generate a first-draft entry for the Content services section of the Cloud Pak for Business Automation What's New topic, which I edited for accuracy and style guide compliance.
