# About me
I am an award-winning content developer and technical writer at IBM with 5 years of experience working on Data and AI enterprise software. Before starting my career at IBM, I worked as a technical writer intern at Akamai Technologies and a grant writer intern at UMass Medical School. In addition to my work experience, I earned my master's degree in technical communication from North Carolina State University and my bachelor's degree in English Literature from the College of the Holy Cross.

## Animations and diagrams
I've created and edited visual aids such as animations and diagrams to enhance the user experience in the product documentation. I use Camtasia to create animated GIFs and draw.io to create and edit diagrams.

## What's new in IBM Business Automation Workflow
The What's new in IBM Business Automation Workflow topic highlights new IBM Business Automation Workflow features for both current and prospective clients. I collaborate with product management, developers, and other stakeholders to write engaging entries for each product version release.

I lead the development of the What's new topic for the following versions of Business Automation Workflow:

- [25.0.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/25.0.0?topic=information-whats-new-in-25000)
- [24.0.1.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/24.0.x?topic=new-in-24010)
- [24.0.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/24.0.x?topic=new-in-24000)
- [23.0.2](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/23.0.x?topic=new-in-2302)
- [23.0.1](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/23.0.x?topic=new-in-2301)

## Generative AI
As AI technology advances, I am exploring ways to incorporate AI into my daily workflows and use generative AI to increase productivity and enhance IBM's product documentation. All content generated by AI is reviewed and edited for accuracy and compliance with IBM style guidelines.

- [Content Management Interoperability Service audit events](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=records-filenet-content-manager-audit-log#reference_ic5_hjh_gfc__cmis_audit_events__title__1)
I used AI to convert input from the development team into a DITA XML table for the reference documentation.
- [Content services new features and enhancements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=notes-whats-new-in-2500#whatsnew__content)
I used AI to generate a first-draft entry for the Content services section of the Cloud Pak for Business Automation What's New topic, which I edited for accuracy and style guide compliance.
